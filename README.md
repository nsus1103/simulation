# simulation models
## Customer Service simulation : 
Model to simulate customer service with customers arriving interval following Poisson distribution (rate=1)
and service times following Exponential distribution. Each customer has a patience (uniformly distributed)
and does not wait longer than the patience interval.

## Tournament:
Model to simulate a tournament of 7 games, with probability of a 'BlueJays' win in a game uniformly distributed between upper and lower bounds.
